    <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer
        instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to 
        physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the 
        work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all
        information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software 
        includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as 
        online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each 
        other and neither can be realistically used on its own.<p>
